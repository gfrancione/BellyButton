BellyButton Challenge

Completing this challenge I had substantial help from my classmates and a tutor session.

I feel that quite a bit of the struggle that I had came from stopping and starting with this assignement and not always picking backup where I left off.

I also created alot of confusion by using loading the json and trying to input the samples manually. 

Ok, 2nd Attempt,

I had to use a tutor 2X, I really struggle trying to find clues from the interative window as to know what I should be address.
